          The My International College/SS, established in 2000, has been consistent in its approach to redefine how quality education should be imparted to students in ways that do not only nurture their academic knowledge and skills but also encourage and motivate them to become better human beings. We strive to attain the challenging goal of blending competitive education with a range of extracurricular activities so that our students can excel in activities and situations that demand their personal knacks on issues that do not usually make subjects in their class rooms. We are inclined towards developing and maintaining an educational environment conducive to students with different interests and aspirations. We believe that such an approach to education is both prompt and pertinent for the overall development of students, whether through pure academic pursuits or extracurricular ambitions. There is a saying, “Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself or herself,” and TTIC makes the students prepare to change themselves towards positive attitudes. The college has well-furnished and sophisticated rooms along with “fully equipped infrastructure." Our societies have become so competitive and globalized. Ordinary learning can’t pave the way to success in today’s world. The college molds the students academically, internationally, and, above all, spiritually to take the bull by the horns for their mesmerizing future and career. The college does not provide them only with theoretical aspects but also gives more priority to their practical aspects, taking them on field visits, conducting seminars, conferences, symposiums, and course-related workshops, along with non-credit courses for their leadership and personality development. As educators, not only for the students but also for the economic growth of the country, ensuring the “dignity and image” of the nation, students should be molded and nurtured in such a way that ascertains both the scientific as well as humanistic vision mentioned, and the college welcomes all those students, guardians, and professionals to step up to the promises of the college.
